# Expense-Tracker
📌 Project Overview

The Expense Tracker Application is a web-based financial management tool that helps users track their income and expenses efficiently. The application performs real-time calculations, categorizes transactions, and stores data locally in the browser, simulating real-world business logic.

🎯 Key Features

Add income and expense transactions

Transaction details include:

Amount

Category

Date

Description

Automatic calculation of:

Total income

Total expenses

Current balance

Category-wise transaction display

Monthly expense summary

Delete individual transactions

Persistent storage using LocalStorage

Responsive and professional UI design

🧠 How It Works

User enters transaction details through a form

Transactions are stored as objects inside an array

JavaScript dynamically updates:

Transaction list

Balance calculations

Data is saved in LocalStorage, ensuring persistence across page reloads

Users can delete transactions, and calculations update instantly

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Form structure and layout

CSS3 – Styling, layout, responsive design

JavaScript (ES6+) – Business logic, calculations, UI updates

LocalStorage – Data persistence

🚀 JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated

Arrays and objects

Array methods (map, filter, reduce)

DOM manipulation

Event listeners

Form validation

LocalStorage CRUD operations

Dynamic UI rendering

✅ Why This Project Stands Out

The Expense Tracker simulates real-world financial workflows and demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to manage application state, perform calculations, and persist data without a backend.
